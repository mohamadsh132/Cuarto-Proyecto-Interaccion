# Mini-Project-4

Using the OSC Controller app (Open Sound Control) and the PureData (PD) language, you must create a DJ system. You should use all the widgets from the app's layout (sliders and buttons), and each interaction with a widget must have an auditory response in PD, allowing you to create electronic music pieces in the style of a DJ.

Limitations:

● OSC and Pure Data must be used.

● Different interactions provided by OSC (sliders, buttons, etc.) must be implemented.

● All interactions should affect the audio in PD.

● A video no longer than 5 minutes must be uploaded to YouTube demonstrating how the system works (a demo with a song).

### Explanation of functionalities

Generation of a base with random notes and pitch control:

● Main functionality: When pressing the first button, a musical base consisting of a sequence of random notes is generated.

● Pitch modification: A slider allows for adjusting the pitch (the height of the sound) of these notes. This means that the frequency of the notes can be altered to make them higher or lower while the base continues playing.

The purpose of this functionality is to experiment with different tonalities and variations of the notes, adjusting the sound in real-time.

Frequency modulator with volume and frequency control:

● Functionality: This feature uses two axes to control two key parameters of the notes: volume and frequency.

● Volume axis: Modifies how loud or soft the music sounds (amplitude).

● Frequency axis: Allows real-time adjustment of the frequency (tone or pitch) of the notes.

The purpose of this functionality is to allow simultaneous manipulation of both parameters, creating dynamic sound effects by varying both the volume and the frequency.

Selector of 24 notes with different octaves:

● Functionality: A set of 24 different notes is available, and these notes can be used across several octaves.

● Octaves: The octaves range from the highest to the lowest, allowing access to a wide tonal range from the highest to the lowest frequencies.

The purpose is to provide flexibility in musical creation, enabling the user to select specific notes within different octave ranges.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recording functionality:

● Functionality: This allows you to record the music you create using the previous features (random notes, pitch control, frequency modulator, note and octave selector).

The entire process is captured, allowing you to revisit your compositions after using all the available tools.
